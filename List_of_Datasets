Datasets:
1. Our dataset is for the Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities                                                [Visit Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bonastreyair/predicting-blood-analysis/data)
and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict 
whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.


2. Smart Platform for Data Blood Bank Management: Forecasting Demand in Blood Supply Chain Using Machine Learning.                            [Visit Link](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/14/1/31)
The proposed solution provides robust and accurate predictions and identifies important clinical predictors for blood demand forecasting. 
Compared with the past yearâ€™s historical data, our integrated proposed system increased collected blood volume by 11%,
decreased inventory wastage by 20%, and had a low incidence of shortages.
